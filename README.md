# PySpark to perform Data Processing

[![PySpark CI/CD](https://github.com/nogibjj/IDS-Week10_MiniProject_us26/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/IDS-Week10_MiniProject_us26/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Overview
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark. It enables you to perform real-time, large-scale data processing in a distributed environment using Python. It also provides a PySpark shell for interactively analyzing your data.

PySpark combines Pythonâ€™s learnability and ease of use with the power of Apache Spark to enable processing and analysis of data at any size for everyone familiar with Python.

## Code Description

       - spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataManipulation").getOrCreate()

SparkSession: This is the entry point for using Spark in your application. It provides a unified interface to work with Spark functionality.

.builder: This is a method that returns a SparkSession.Builder object, which is used to configure various Spark session properties.

.appName("DataManipulation"): This sets the name of your Spark application to "DataManipulation." This name is useful for identifying your application when viewing Spark applications in the Spark UI or logs.

.getOrCreate(): This method either gets an existing Spark session or creates a new one if it doesn't already exist. It ensures that only one Spark session is active within your application.

## CI/CD Automation files

1. requirements.txt - Contains all the required python packages
2. Makfefile - Using make to automate different parts of developing a Python project, like -
   
       1. running tests
       2. cleaning builds
       3. installing dependencies
   
   Integrating it into my routine, so can save time and avoid errors.

3. .github/workflows - This directory in a Python project (or any GitHub repository) is used for creating and storing GitHub Actions workflows. GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery                           (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub. The workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch. It sets up :
   
       1. Python environment
       2. Installs project dependencies
       3. Install packages
       4. Linitng
       5. Runs tests
       6. Format
